## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, try these steps:

### 1. Check Your Files
- Ensure there's a folder named "Reports" in the same directory as the script.
- Place exactly two Excel files in the "Reports" folder:
  - One file with leave requests
  - One file with employee work areas
- Remove any other files from the "Reports" folder.

### 2. First-Time Setup
If this is your first time running the program, you may need to install required packages:

1. Open a terminal in the script's folder.
2. Run this command:


   pip install pandas openpyxl pytz xlrd 


3. Wait for the installation to complete.

### 3. Common Issues
- If you see error messages, double-check your Excel files and try running the program again.
- Ensure no Excel files are currently open when running the script.

### 4. Still Having Problems?
If the program still doesn't work after trying these steps, contact your IT support team for assistance.
